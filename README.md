Architecture overview
- Front end
  - Next.js pages and API routes
  - Client-side state via React Context and SWR for data fetching
  - UI styled with Tailwind CSS and small shared component library
- Back end
  - Serverless functions for link ingestion and summarization
  - Supabase Postgres for data and storage
  - Background jobs for checks and batch summarization
- Summarizer
  - A small microservice that parses page HTML and extracts main text
  - Runs a lightweight model or external summarization API
- Deployment
  - Vercel hosts the front end
  - Supabase handles DB and auth
  - Optional Google Cloud functions can host the summarizer at scale

Data model (core tables)
- users: id, email, name, created_at
- links: id, user_id, url, title, notes, created_at, updated_at
- summaries: id, link_id, text, model, created_at
- tags: id, name, user_id
- link_tags: link_id, tag_id

API endpoints (examples)
- GET /api/links - list links, supports query params for filters
- POST /api/links - create a link
- GET /api/links/:id - fetch link details and summary
- POST /api/links/:id/summary - trigger a new summary
- POST /api/import - upload markdown/JSON for bulk import
- GET /api/export - export selected links to markdown/JSON

Summarizer details
- The summarizer fetches the target URL, extracts the main article content, and returns a short extract.
- The service supports different output lengths: short (1-2 sentences), medium (3-4 sentences), long (full paragraph).
- You can run the service locally as a serverless function or deploy it to Google Cloud for scale.
- Keep API keys for external NLP services in server-only env variables.

Testing
- Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration tests run on Node for API routes
- Test command: pnpm test
- CI runs on push and pull requests and reports coverage

Code style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Prettier for formatting
- ESLint with recommended rules and custom rules for accessibility
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits
- Run linters: pnpm lint
- Auto format: pnpm format

UI and accessibility
- Focus on keyboard navigation
- High contrast mode
- Semantic HTML for screen readers
- ARIA attributes for dynamic dialogs and lists

Deployment
- Recommended: Vercel for Next.js front end
- Configure environment variables in Vercel:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (server-side)
- For the summarizer, you can deploy a container to Google Cloud Run or use Vercel serverless functions.
- Use the Releases page to fetch prebuilt server binaries when available: https://github.com/SSasone52/link-saver-app/releases

Integrations
- Supabase for auth and DB
- Optional Google Cloud Console hooks for advanced compute
- Web clipper browser extension (sample code in /extensions)
- Markdown export for notes and link lists

Import / Export
- Import: CSV, JSON, Markdown (frontmatter accepted)
- Export: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter or JSON payloads
- Use the bulk import API for automated migrations

Security
- Auth with Supabase using JWT
- Server-only keys kept in env and not shipped to the client
- Rate limits on summarizer endpoints
- Periodic scans for dangerous content in user-submitted notes

Performance
- Server-side caching for summaries
- Incremental Static Regeneration for public collections
- Lazy load link previews and images
- Use CDN for static assets in production

Contributing
- Read the code of conduct in the repo
- Fork the repo and create feature branches
- Create a PR with tests and a clear description
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Follow commit message and code style rules

Issue templates
- bug: include steps to reproduce and device/OS
- feature: include a concrete example and UI sketch
- docs: point to the file to change and include expected text

Roadmap
- Team collections and shared folders
- Smart folders with rule-based auto-tagging
- Mobile app with native clipper
- Advanced summarizer models and voice output

Troubleshooting (common fixes)
- If dev server fails to start, check env variables and port conflicts.
- If summaries fail, verify summarizer API key and outbound network access.
- If auth fails, re-check Supabase keys and CORS settings.
